# Kickstarter_Challange

## Overview of Project
In this project I combed through data of various fundraising events throughout the world to make a recommendation to Louise for her own event. I explored the fundamentals of Excel to learn which tools will better help me present my findings to Louise. 

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to help Louise with her fundraising campaign. I wanted to determine which month is best suited to launch her play, and which range of fundraising goals were most successful. 

## Analysis
I preformed the analysis by filtering the data, and creating separate worksheets for each section. Once certain data was pulled, I was able to create a graph to visually show the results. Itâ€™s important to adjust the formatting so that the chart is easy to read, and the results accurately show the findings. 
### Analysis Based on Launch Date
After analyzing the various launch dates, I found that May was the most successful, while December is the least. The graph below confirms these details:
